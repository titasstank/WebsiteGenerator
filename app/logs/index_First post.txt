                    <p>Did you know, that the cat (Felis catus) is the only domesticated species in
                        the Felidae family, and to distinguish it from the other
                        wild cats in the family, it is often referred to as the domestic cat or house cat. A cat can
                        be
                        a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat - the latter roams freely and avoids interaction
                        with
                        people. Humans appreciate domestic cats for their company and their capacity to eradicate
                        rats.
                        There are over 60 cat breeds recognized by several cat registries. The anatomy of cats is
                        comparable to that of other felid species; they have strong, flexible bodies, rapid
                        reflexes,
                        keen teeth, and retractable claws that are designed to destroy tiny prey.</p>
